# RAG Zephyr Project

**Effortlessly build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Zephyr and LangChain, with GitHub issues as your knowledge base.**

---

##  Project Overview

This project showcases a streamlined RAG pipeline that combines:

- A lightweight yet powerful LLM: **`HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`**  
- A fast, in-memory retriever built using **LangChain** and **FAISS**  
- GitHub issue data (both open and closed) as a real-world knowledge source

It pulls relevant context at query time, preventing hallucination and ensuring fresh, on-point responsesâ€”no model fine-tuning required. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

##  Why It Matters

Modern LLMs often lack awareness of emerging or proprietary content (e.g., newly opened GitHub issues). Fine-tuning is costly and can shift model behavior over time.

**RAG solves this by dynamically retrieving embeddings as context**, so your model is always aware of the latest content. Plus, swapping out to a better LLM is seamless. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
